This is a We-chat public account service system based on Java 6.

We built this project formaly for the @fduxxb we-chat account, and finally we decided to make it open to public, whick we think would help someone worked on Java, escpecially whom in univercities and campus.

We would like to give our appreciation to the fantastic projects of MongoDB and Struts2 , as this project is mainly based on them.
We would also give big thanks to Information Office of Fudan University which we full-time work in, and our director Prof. Yong Mi who support this project. 
Finally this project works on We-chat, so also thank Tencent Co. publishing such an amazing IM and open platform.
