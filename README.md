This is a We-chat public account service system based on Java 7.

We built this project formaly for the @fduxxb we-chat account, and finally we decided to make it open to public, which we think would help someone worked on Java, escpecially whom in universities and campuses.

We would like to give our appreciation to the fantastic projects of MongoDB, Struts2 and Bootstrap , as this project is mainly based on them.
We would also give big thanks to Information Office of Fudan University which we full-time work in, and our director Prof. Yong Mi who support this project. 
Finally this project works on We-chat, so also thank Tencent Co. publishing such an amazing IM and open platform.
